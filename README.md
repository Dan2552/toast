Summary
=======

__Toast__ is an extension to Ruby on Rails that lets you expose any
ActiveRecord model as a _resource_ according to the REST pradigm.

In contrast to other plugins, Gems and Rails inbuild REST features
__toast__ takes a data centric approach: Tell the model to be
_RESTful_. Don't write any controller code. Toast will do that for you
following the Rails and REST conventions.
